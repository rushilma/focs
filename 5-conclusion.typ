This thesis is the culmination of two weeks of frantic work and two decades of personal growth, and I would have never made it far on either timescale without the $omega(1)$ people who have supported, taught, cared for, and loved me.
I am incredibly lucky to have so many people to be grateful for, and am honored to get to thank them here.

First, my deepest gratitude to my advisors.
To Professor Subhabrata Sen, thank you for introducing me to the wonders of stochastic processes and having me on your teaching staff.
For a brief moment my freshman spring, I contemplated dropping Stat 171, but I am beyond glad I stuck with it -- getting to work with you has been a wonderful experience.
And to Professor Mark Sellke, thank you so much for providing me with such an interesting problem to work on; without your guidance, I doubt this thesis would be half as interesting as it is.
I can hardly think of a class that challenged me to improve my intuitions more than Stat 291, and with high probability I'll make good use of those skills for long into the future.

To that end, I would also like to thank Professor Joe Blitzstein. Stat 110, 111, and 210 were some of the most impactful classes I have taken, and I doubt I would love statistics nearly as much if not for your unique teaching style and dedication to your students. To my math professors and graduate students as well -- Mike Hopkins, Elden Elmanto, Freid Tong, Natalie Stewart -- I owe you so much for fostering my intellectual curiosity and showing me the fantastical worlds you inhabit each day.

My four years here have been defined more than anything by the wonderful people I've met and the friends I've made.
Thank you to Matthew Nazari and Bella Tarantino, for making me feel at home in an unfamiliar place.
To Peter and Eunice Chon, for being honest when I needed honesty, kind when I needed kindness, and wise when I needed wisdom.
To Yuyuan Luo and Eunice Zhang, and all my friends from MIT, for welcoming me from across Mass Ave and being wonderful and fun friends to be around.
Thank you to Peter Luo, for looking out for me, and to Cecil Yang, for sticking with me.
And an especially big thank you to Jarell Cheong, whose keen eye for details and dedication to being a reliable friend were almost surely responsible for me making it through the thesis-writing process.

Finally, I cannot be thankful enough for my Mom, my Dad, my sister Arushi, my _Nani_, and my aunts and uncles and cousins from across the country and around the world.
I owe everything to you for teaching me to be a better student and a good person, and I look forward to a life spent practicing the values you've instilled in me. All I have to say is this:
