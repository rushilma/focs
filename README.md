# Rushil Mallarapu - Senior Thesis

**NOTE: `5-litref.typ` is fake chapter - just there for my sake to organize writing for chapter 1.**

# How to build

Main file is `main.typ`.

To build (with live reloading), either run `build.fish` if you have fish, or run
```sh
$ typst watch main.typ --font-path fonts/
```

## Organization:
- `fonts/`: Directory of fonts.

## TODO:
- In Ch. 3 and 4, change $p_"solve"$, etc to have superscripts for (1) poly, (2) low coord degree (LCD), and (3) hat algorithms $hat(p)^lcd _"solve"
